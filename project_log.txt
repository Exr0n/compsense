It's 18 April 2019 and computers are cool. Can we get them to extrapolate information?

Goal: Read the first line of a bunch of wikipedia pages, then parse them and somehow "remember" that information. Then, output a sentence of "common sense" that fits in with other things on conceptnet.io

Is it doable? Probably.
Can I do it? Probably not.

Lets get started!
